                <p>  <b> Comet</b> is an asteroid-like object that is not made up of much rock, but mostly ice. It is described by some experts by the phrase "dirty snowball" because it contains carbon dioxide, methane and water that freezes with dirt and quality. Most elliptical orbits are very flattened, with some orbiting points much further away than Pluto.</p>

Many of the stars have a prospect in the area called the Cloud. This is the seek out of the stars, a player area, include of the quality to back from the Face God was just beginning to take shape. The quality here is too far away to withstand very little gravity from the center, did not fall into the solar disk, to become the Sun and the computers. Here the temperature is also very low, causing substances such as carbon dioxide, methane and water to freeze. Occasionally some collision or orbital turbulence sends some thin matter flying into the center. As they approach the Sun, the temperature increases the quality of the evaporating star and, under the pressure of the solar wind, produces dust and gas tails, which, as their name implies, appear female.</p>
                <p>   Sometimes there are books with a fishtail, visible to the naked eye: The long tail is on the opposite side of the Sun, and the short tail is directed towards the Sun. The reason is: When at close range, the destructive power of the Sun's rays on the surface is strong enough for the matter in the meteor and to shoot far away. The solar wind did not push all the clouds back, but a short tail.</p>

                <h5>History of discovery</h5>
                <h6>Early times</h6>
                <p> The Bayeux carpet, 11th century, describes the 1066 Halley observation
                    According to the tags engraved on the bones of the ancient Chinese people, the presence of the comet has been known to humans for thousands of years. The ancient Chinese believed that comets brought bad omen, foreshadowing the danger of life for kings or mandarins. However, in the book of Thien Thien, Tuan Tu (313-230 BC) denied this superstition. In the history of Greek and Arab civilizations, comets were once considered the attack of heaven on earth. The "falling star" records in the Gilgamesh, Revelation and Enoch books may refer to the comet or meteor.</p>
                <p> In his first book Meteorology, Aristotle commented on comets flying back and forth in the Western sky for two thousand years. He turned to the notion of some of the early philosophers who described comets as planets, or phenomena related to planets. He relied on observations of the motion of planets near the ecliptic, while comets could appear from anywhere, to conclude that comets were phenomena occurring in the stratosphere. High in Earth's atmosphere, where hot and dry jets of gas gather and sometimes burn. He extended this mechanism to account for both meteorites, auroras and, even, the Milky Way.</p>
                <p>   The sages later debated this view of the comet. Seneca Young, in Questions of Nature, observed comets fly back and forth in regular orbits, unaffected by wind, a characteristic of cosmic rather than atmospheric phenomena. Although he also agrees that the planets all move near the ecliptic, he sees no reason to prevent planet-like objects from traveling in other skies, and that your knowledge. space people are still limited. However, Aristotle's view was still deeply influential; it was not until the 16th century that comets were out of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>  In 1577, a bright comet was observed for several months. The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe used measurements of the comet's position by himself and by observers at a far distance, to obtain a comet with very small parallax. can't be measured. Given the accuracy of the measurements at the time, this is evidence that the comet must be at least four times the distance between the Earth and the Moon.</p>

                <h6>Orbital calculation</h6>
                <p>  Since the 16th century, although comets have been shown to be cosmic phenomena, the question of how they move remains the subject of controversy for the next century. Even after Johannes Kepler determined in 1609 that the planets were traveling around the Sun in elliptical orbits, he was hesitant to apply the laws of planetary motion to other objects; he believed that comets move between planets in a straight line. Galileo Galilei, though a Nicolaus Copernican, rejected Tycho's measurement of parallax and believed Aristotle's interpretation of comets flying in a straight line in the atmosphere.</p>

                <p>   The first to suggest the application of Kepler's laws to comets was William Lower in 1610. Over the following decades, astronomers such as Pierre Petit, Giovanni Borelli, Adrien Auzout, Robert Hooke and Jean-Dominique Cassini both confirmed that the comet circled the Sun in elliptical or parabolic orbits. While others, like Christian Huygens and Johannes Hevelius, favor the linear motion of the comet.</p>
                <p> The problem was solved by Gottfried Kirch's discovery of a bright comet on November 14, 1680. Astronomers across Europe have been tracking and measuring the comet's path for months. In his Principia Mathematica, written in 1687, Isaac Newton demonstrated that an object moving under the inverse square function of the universal force of gravity must follow a trajectory like a conical cut, and he showed how to fit comet orbits into a parabola, using comet 1680 as an example.</p>


                <p>  In 1705, Edmond Halley used Newton's method for 24 comet phenomena that occurred between 1337 and 1698. He found that three of them, comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682, had parameters. orbits are very similar, and he also discovered that the slight difference between the orbits is due to gravity from Jupiter and Saturn. Convinced that the three phenomena all belonged to a comet, he predicted it would go back around 1758 to 1759. (Previously, Robert Hooke identified the phenomenon in 1664 and in 1618 as belonging to a comet, and Jean-Dominique Cassini questioned the similarities of the three phenomena in 1577, 1665 and 1680; but both were wrong.) Halley's comet prediction was later recalculated by a The group of French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. They predicted the date when the comet would be near orbit in 1759, with an error of about a month. When the comet returned as predicted, it was named Halley comet (its official name is 1P / Halley). Its 21st century date is 2061.</p>

                <p> Among comets whose periods are short enough to be recorded many times in history, Comet Halley is unique in that it is always bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Since the prediction of Halley's comet's periodic orbit has been recognized, many comets with repeating cycles have been observed using telescopes. The second comet found to return is Comet Encke (official name 2P / Encke). Between 1819 and 1821, German mathematician and physicist Johann Franz Encke calculated orbits for a series of comet phenomena in 1786, 1795, 1805 and 1818, and came to the conclusion that they were all belong to a comet; he accurately predicted its return date in 1822. By the 1900s, 17 comets had been observed to have passed the paradigm at least twice, and were therefore classified as periodic comets. As of January 2005, this number was 164, although some of them had been missing or destroyed in collisions with other celestial bodies.</p>

                <h6>Structure research</h6>
                <p>Isaac Newton described the comet as a compact, compact body. In other words, it is a kind of planet that moves in very distorted orbits, coming from all directions with a high degree of freedom, keeping its motion intact even when passing between planets; their tails are thin jets of steam emanating from the head, the comet's nucleus, that burn off or be heated by energy from the Sun. The comet also suggested to Newton a seemingly indispensable conclusion about the conservation of water and moisture on the planet: from particles of water and moisture, plants produce plants, they grow when they absorb water, when they die and rot, they become dry ground. Thus, the dry soil will be more and more increasing, and the moisture will always decrease, at a time it will evaporate, if there is no source of supply. Newton believes that this supply comes from comets, making it the most delicate source of life for the air, essential for the life and existence of all species.</p>

                <p>Another comet mission that Newton surmised was that they fuel the Sun, compensating for the Sun's energy consumption with a stream of bright comets coming from all directions.
                    Since the 18th century, many scientists have had quite accurate theories about the composition of comets. In 1755, Immanuel Kant assumed that comets are made of highly sublimated matter, and evaporation creates a glowing tail when nearing point. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing the vapor emitted from comet Halley in 1835, assumed that the jet of evaporated material might be strong enough to change the trajectory of the comet and that comet Encke's lawless motion is rooted in this mechanism.</p>

                <p>However, a subsequent comet discovery overshadowed these ideas for a century. Between 1864 and 1866 the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli calculated the orbits of the Perseid meteors and, based on orbital similarities, correctly assumed that the Perseid meteors were fragments of comet Swift-Tuttle. The connection between comets and meteors continued to heat up in 1872 when a massive meteorite appeared in the orbit of comet Biela, a comet that has been observed splitting into two pieces when it appears. 1846 and has disappeared since 1852. A model called the "gravel groove" of comet structure has formed, depicting the comet as a pile of pebbles, loosely bound in ice and snow.</p>

                <p>By the mid-20th century, this pattern began to exhibit many weaknesses: for example, it did not explain why an object containing a thin ice shell could produce enough steam evaporating into a brilliant tail in many like that. In 1950, Fred Lawrence Whipple proposed to replace the model of pebbles in the ice crust with a large piece of ice mixed with dust and gravel. This "dirty snowball" model was then quickly adopted. It was confirmed after a series of spacecraft expeditions (including the European Space Agency's Giotto and the Soviet Vega 1 and Vega 2) flying over the head of comet Halley in 1986 to photograph particles. multiply and watch the flow of steam coming back behind. American Deep Space 1 flew over the nucleus of comet Borrelly on September 21, 2001 and verified that the characteristics of Halley's comet could also be found in other comets.</p>

                <p> Ongoing and ongoing excursions continue to provide more information about the comet's makeup. Stardust, launched in February 1999, collected dust particles from the head of comet Wild 2 in January 2004, and will return the specimen to Earth in 2006. In July 2005, the Deep Impact bombarded a hole in comet Tempel 1 to study its internal structure. In 2014, Rosetta will circle the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko and put on its surface a research station.</p>

                <h6>Characteristics</h6>
                <p>  Comets are composed of methane carbon dioxide and frozen water mixed with polymeric organic compounds and other minerals. They circle the Sun in very flat orbits and are very far away from the Sun for most of their lives, in a frozen state at low temperatures. As the comet approaches the Sun, that is, into the inner Solar System, the Sun's electromagnetic radiation causes the outer ice layers to begin to sublimate. The flux of dust and gas creates a large but very thin "atmosphere" around the comet called the comet head. Moving closer, radiant pressure and solar wind blowing into this atmosphere stretched it into two giant tails. Dust and gas create two separate tails, pointed in two slightly different directions;
                    Massive dust particles are not easily affected by the solar wind, are only separated from the head of the comet and slow down in orbit just after the head (so the tail curves to the curve of the orbit) the gas tail (rather ionized gas) contains light ionic particles, which are easily blown by the solar wind in a straight line to the Sun, and then follow the magnetic field line in space instead of the orbital line. religion. The comet nucleus that lies inside are heavy minerals, or polymeric organic matter, only about 50 kilometers in diameter. Whereas the head of a comet can be larger than the Sun, while the tail of a comet can extend to the size of an astronomical unit or more.</p>

                <p> Both the head and tail, which form when a comet enters the inner Solar System, are illuminated by the Sun and can become dazzling for observations from Earth. The dust tail scatters the sunlight directly by the Mie mechanism, creating white, while the ionized gas tail emits high-energy photons with a blue bias spectrum. In fact, most comets are so weak that they can only be seen through a telescope. Every decade, only a few comets are bright enough to be viewed with the naked eye. Before the telescope, comets appeared to appear suddenly and then suddenly disappear in the sky.</p>

                <p> It may be surprising that the nuclei of a comet are among the darkest objects in the Solar System. Giotto measured that the nucleus of comet Halley reflected 4% of the incoming light, while Deep Space 1 found the comet Borrelly to have a reflectivity of only about 2.4% to 3%; For comparison, asphalt reflects 7% of light. This dark surface can be explained through the structure of the nucleus consisting mainly of organic compounds. The sun's heat evaporates light compounds, leaving behind heavy molecules with very long organic chains that tend to darken in color, like ash or crude oil. The black color of comets creates a strong heat absorption, enhancing the evaporation of gases.</p>

                <p> In 1996, the comet was found to emit X-rays. These rays surprised scientists because no one had predicted this before. The mechanism that emits X-rays can be explained by the interaction between comets and the solar wind: when ions fly from the Sun across the tail of the comet, they collide with atoms or molecules in the tail. During collisions, positively charged ions will capture one or several electrons from the comet's tail. The tail of the comet is ionized, and electrons dropped into ions coming from the Sun emit photons of the ultraviolet or X-ray frequency.</p>

                <h6>Trajectory</h6>
                <p>   According to orbit, comets are divided into categories: short-term comets with an orbital period of less than 200 years, long-term comets with a larger, but still returning, orbit, and transient comets. has a parabolic or hyperbola orbit that only crosses the Sun once and dies forever after. An example of this is the short-term comet, whose comet Encke has a tiny orbit that never moves further from the Sun than Jupiter.


                    As any celestial body moves in orbit under the influence of gravity, comets move fastest at the orbital point and slowest at the far orbital point.</p>


                <p>Because comets are small, when they pass by large planets, their orbits are prone to turbulence. For short-term comets, the result of this turbulence, in the long run, causes their orbital points to coincide with the orbital radii of the large planets, where the group of comets near Jupiter has a volume, as shown in the histogram. Jupiter is the most powerful source of perturbation, because its mass is twice that of the other planets, and it moves faster than the other major planets. Long-term comets are also frequently perturbed when traversing major planets.</p>

                <p> These gravitational interactions make it difficult to predict the orbits of many comets. Many comets observed decades ago have gone missing, as their orbits have changed and their return locations for tracking are unpredictable. Occasionally, however, a "new" comet is discovered and then, after calculating its orbit, is discovered to be a "missing" comet. The comet 11P / Tempel-Swift-LINEAR, for example, was observed in 1869 and then no longer visible in 1908 due to Jupiter's turbulence, and was suddenly found by chance by LINEAR in 2001.</p>

                <p>
                    Hundreds of tiny comets pass near the Sun each year, but only a few are large enough to be known to the public. About every decade a comet appears bright enough to be observed with the naked eye; These comets are known as great comets. Large comets have often had negative reactions in the public in the past, because they were thought to bring bad things. During its 1910 return, the tail of comet Halley swept through the Earth, causing unfounded concern that the cyanogen in the tail could cause poisoning to humans. Or like the arrival of comet Hale-Bopp in 1997 caused a mass suicide of the fanatic group of Heaven's Gate. However, large comets are, for the most part, just a beautiful natural phenomenon
