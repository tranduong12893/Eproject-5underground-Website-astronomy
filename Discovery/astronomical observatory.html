                <p><span class="firstcharacter">1</span></p>
                <p>This observatory is located in Chile which is considered as a major hotspot for science. Chile already has a number of observatories and this happens to be the most popular among them. The Paranal Observatory is operated by the European Southern Observatory and is made open to the weekend visitors who come to see the Very Large telescope here. The VLT comprises of four small telescopes namely, Kueyen, Antu, Melipal and Yepun which mean Moon, Sun, Southern Cross as well as Venus. These are used in context to create an interferometer allowing the astronomers to see the details up to 25 times finer than with the individual telescopes. You can make the most of the guided tours carried on here, especially during the weekends. They don’t charge you, but a reservation is required.</p>
