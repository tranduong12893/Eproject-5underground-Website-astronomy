                <p>n eclipse is a phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun on the same line and observed from the Earth, at which time the Moon completely or partially obscures the Sun. This can only happen at the time of the new moon when viewed from the Earth, when the Sun is obscured by the Moon and the Moon's shadow overlaps the Earth. During a total solar eclipse, the sun disc was completely obscured. With a partial or annular eclipse, the solar disc is only partially obscured. </p>
                <p>If the Moon had a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be a total eclipse occurring every once in a month. However, the Moon's orbit is more than 5 ° tilted from the Earth's orbit around the Sun (see the ecliptic plane), so the Moon's shadow during the new moon does not normally shine on the Earth. For an eclipse as well as an eclipse to happen, the Moon must pass through the plane of Earth's orbit. Furthermore, the Moon's orbit is elliptical, and it is often far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to completely obscure the Sun at the time of the eclipse. The orbital planes of the Moon and Earth each year intersect at the orbit's up and down nodes; and there is at least 2 and at most 5 eclipses occurring in a year, nor can there be more than two total eclipses in the same year. However, in a specific place on Earth, a total solar eclipse is very rare because the shadow of the Moon during it falls on Earth in a narrow band and for a short time, with the longest time of about 7 minutes (total solar eclipse July 20, 1955). </p>
                <p>The phenomenon of obscuration is a phenomenon of nature. However, in ancient history and the conception of some modern people, the eclipse belonged to a supernatural phenomenon. A total eclipse caused fear among ancient people due to a lack of understanding of astronomy, when the Sun seemed to disappear during the day and the sky was dark for a few minutes. </p>
                <p>Very dangerous to eyes when looking directly into the Sun. Therefore, to observe direct eclipse, it is necessary to use eyeglasses or indirectly observe images at the eclipse. But when a total eclipse occurs, the eye can safely observe this phenomenon while the Moon completely obscures the Sun. People who enjoy this phenomenon often travel to impending places to witness and take pictures. </p>

                <h2>Types of eclipses</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span></p>
                <p><br>here are four types of eclipses: </p>
                <p>A total eclipse occurs when the dark disc of the Moon completely obscures the Sun, allowing the halo surrounding the Sun or the corona to be seen visually with a protective device. During any one eclipse, a total eclipse can only be observed from a narrow band on the Earth's surface. An annular eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon lie exactly in a straight line, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than the apparent size of the Sun. So the Sun still appears as a brilliant ring around the Moon. An annular eclipse takes place longer than a total solar eclipse but also only lasts a few minutes. [8] [9] A hybrid eclipse is an intermediate type of solar eclipse between a total and an annular eclipse. At some points on Earth it is observed as a total eclipse; elsewhere it is an annular eclipse. The general term for a total, annular or hybrid eclipse is a central eclipse.</p>
                <p>Hybrid eclipses are very rare. A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly on the same line, and the Moon obscures only a portion of the Sun. This phenomenon is usually observed in many places on Earth outside the path of the central eclipse. However, some types of eclipses can only be observed as partial eclipses, when the shadow area (umbra) slides over one of the Earth's polar regions and the center line does not now cross the surface of the Earth. Land. The distance from the Sun to Earth is approximately 400 times the distance from the Moon to Earth, and the diameter of the Sun is about 400 times that of the Moon. Because these two ratios are approximately equal, when viewed from the Earth, the Sun and Moon have approximately equal apparent sizes: about 0.5 degrees angle. </p>
                <p>Another type of eclipse where the Sun is obscured by a planet other than the Moon when viewed from a point in space. For example, the Apollo 12 space crew captured the Sun obscuring Earth in 1969 and the Cassini spacecraft also captured the Sun obscuring Saturn in 2006. </p>
                <p>The Moon's orbit around the Earth as well as the Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical. Thus, the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon vary with position in orbit. [10] The magnitude of an eclipse is determined by the ratio of the Moon's apparent size to the Sun's apparent size during the eclipse. An eclipse (including an eclipse and a lunar eclipse) that occurs when the Moon is near the near-point (closest to Earth) may become a total eclipse because then the Moon will be large enough to completely obscures the Sun's bright disk, or the photosphere; and now the magnitude of the eclipse is more than 1. On the contrary, the eclipse that occurs when the Moon is at the remote point (the farthest point from the Earth) can be an annular eclipse because when that the Moon has a smaller apparent size than that of the Sun; the magnitude of the eclipse is now less than 1. On average, the annular eclipse occurs more than a total eclipse, because the Moon is quite far from Earth to fully cover the Sun. A hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of the eclipse during the time changes from a value less than 1 to greater than 1, so a total eclipse can be observed in one place on Earth while in Another place observed an annular eclipse. </p>
                <p>The distance from Earth to the Sun varies over a year due to elliptical orbit. This also causes the Sun's apparent size to vary during the year, but this variation is not as much as the apparent size of the Moon. [9] When the Earth is farthest from the Sun in July, and if an eclipse occurs, it is most likely a total eclipse, while if an eclipse occurs when the Earth is closest to the sun at In January, it is most likely an annular eclipse. </p>

                <h2>Frequency and duration of occurrence</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span></p>
                <p>n one place on Earth, a total eclipse is a rare phenomenon. Although it occurs on the planet on average every 18 months a total solar eclipse, [38]. This phenomenon has been calculated to be repeated in any place for an average of 360 to 410 years. The total eclipse lasts for a few minutes at any place, because the shadow of the Moon moves westward at speeds above 1700 km / h. In one place, the time to observe a total eclipse never lasts more than 7 minutes 31 seconds, and is usually less than 5 minutes: in every millennium there are usually less than 10 lasting total eclipses. longer than 7 minutes. The most recent time was a total solar eclipse on June 30, 1973 with 7 minutes 3 seconds. This time, astronomers used a Concorde plane to follow a dark trail of the Moon and observed a total eclipse for about 72 minutes. The next total solar eclipse lasting more than 7 minutes will be on June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse in the 8,000-year period from 3,000 BC to 5,000 will occur on June 16. July 2186, when the time to take place at a special place was about 7 min 29 seconds. [43] By comparison, the longest total eclipse in the twentieth century was 7 minutes 8 seconds on June 20, 1955, and there was no total eclipse lasting more than 7 minutes in the twenty-first century. </p>
                <p>If the date and time of eclipses is known, one can predict future eclipses using eclipse cycles. The Saros cycle is one of the most famous and accurate that ancient astronomers have ever used (see above). The Saros cycle equals 6,585.3 days (over 18 years), meaning that after each of these cycles an identical eclipse will take place. But there is a difference in geographic longitude displaced by about 120 ° (due to a residual of 0.3 days) and a slight deviation in latitude (due to the inclination of the plane of the Moon's orbit). The Saros chain always begins with a partial eclipse near one of the Earth's polar regions, then shifts across the globe through annular and total eclipses, and ends the series with a partial eclipse at polar opposite region. The Saros sequence lasted from 1226 to 1550 years with 69 to 87 eclipses, of which 40 to 60 times were central eclipses. </p>
