                <p>he Milky Way, the Milky Way, or the Milky Way, is a galaxy that contains our Solar System, appearing in the sky as a faint band of light extending from the constellation Cassiopeia. In the north to the constellation of the Southern Crux (Crux) to the south, and brightest in the constellation Sagittarius - the center of the Milky Way, the reason the Milky Way is called the Milky Way is because of god Zeus took his son, Hercules, and gave him the milk of the goddess Hera to become immortal. Suddenly the goddess woke up and the milk was splashed into the sky, from which the name Milky Way was born.</p>
                <p>Galileo Galilei first observed individual stars in the Milky Way in 1610 with his telescope. However, until the 20s of the twentieth century, astronomers still believed that all the universe that man knew at that time was contained in the Milky Way. Until the great debate broke out between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, it was with Edwin Hubble that the Milky Way was just one of many other galaxies.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span></p>
                <p>f viewed from above (in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the disc), the center expands and is surrounded by four large spiral arms. With diameters ranging from about 100,000 to 180,000 light years. It is estimated that between 100 and 400 billion stars are contained, along with more than 100 billion planets, unlike conventional spiral galaxies, rod-shaped spiral galaxies (or broken spiral galaxies). segment) has a barrier-shaped region that runs across its center, and has two main spiral arms. The Milky Way does the same, and has two more smaller spiral arms. One of those small arms is the Orion Spiral Arm, which contains the Solar System, which sits between the large arms, Perseus and Sagittarius.</p>
                <p>The Solar System is located on the inside of the Orion Arm - a spiral structure filled with dust and gas, approximately 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center. Stars within 10,000 light-years form high accretion. Central part with intense radio emission, known as Sagittarius A *. The movement of matter around Sagittarius A * indicated that it contained a very heavy and dense object. This can be explained by the existence of a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way with an estimated mass of 4.1 to 4.5 million times the sun.</p>
                <p>The whole Milky Way moves at a speed of about 600 km / s. It contains the oldest stars in the universe, even with an age that began shortly after the Big Bang. It also rotates around its core. The spiral arms are always moving through space, the Sun and the planets move with them. Our Solar System travels at a speed of 220 km / s, but even with such a fast speed, it takes 230 million years for us to complete a rotation around the core of the Milky Way.</p>
                <p>There are several satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, all belonging to the Local Group, in the Virgo Cluster and the Super Cluster Laniākea.</p>

                <h2>Age of the Milky Way</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span></p>
                <p>here are many ways to determine the age of astronomers, some of which can be compared the heavy radioactive content such as Uranium-238 or Thorium-232 obtained with the first radioactive content. From there we estimate the age of some stars in the Milky Way, for example, with CS 31082-001 it is 12.5 ± 3 billion years, or BD + 17 ° 3248 is 13.8 ± 4 billion years. In 2004, a team of astronomers, including Luca Pasquini, Piercarlo Bonifacio, Sofia Randich, Daniele Galli and Raffaele G. Gratton, calculated the age of the Milky Way. This group is used to use ultraviolet spectroscopy - seen from an extremely large telescope to measure the amount of beryllium in the two stars of the nebula NGC 6397 for the first time. This thing for them to be the time is float through the life ra the first of the stars in the entire Milky Way galaxy and the first birth of stars in this nebula, between 200 and 300 million years. This time period They add up to the symbol of the old stars in the nebula that are 13,400 ± 800 million years. Its sum is the expected age of the Milky Way: 13,600 ± 800 million years.</p>
                <p>File: Following the Milky Way through ALMA.webm A video of the Milky Way's reverse time on ALMA Another method is based on current theory of stellar evolution. Globular populations are the oldest galaxies in the universe, and white dwarfs are the oldest stars in a galaxy. Furthermore, the fainter a dwarf star is, the greater its age. (A dwarf is a star that has about half the mass of the Sun and the volume of the Earth.) The white dwarf will gradually emit heat and light. So by cooling their calculation, and compared to the original temperature, scientists can estimate its age and the age of the universe.</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 45px;">imensions</p>
                <p>The first reliable measurement of the size of the Galaxy was made in 1917 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley. He arrived at his size determination by establishing the spatial distribution of globular clusters. Shapley found that, instead of a relatively small system with the Sun near its centre, as had previously been thought, the Galaxy is immense, with the Sun nearer the edge than the centre. Assuming that the globular clusters outlined the Galaxy, he determined that it has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and that the Sun lies about 30,000 light-years from the centre. (A light-year is the distance traveled by light in one year and is roughly 9,460,000,000,000 km [5,880,000,000,000 miles].) His values have held up remarkably well over the years. Depending in part on the particular component being discussed, the stellar disk of the Milky Way system is just about as large as Shapley’s model predicted, with neutral hydrogen somewhat more widely dispersed and dark (i.e., unobservable) matter perhaps filling an even larger volume than expected. The most-distant stars and gas clouds of the system that have had their distance reliably determined lie roughly 100,000 light-years from the galactic centre, while the distance of the Sun from the centre has been found to be approximately 25,000 light-years.</p>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span></p>
                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 60px;">ass</p>
                <p>The total mass of the Galaxy, which had seemed reasonably well established during the 1960s, has become a matter of considerable uncertainty. Measuring the mass out to the distance of the farthest large hydrogen clouds is a relatively straightforward procedure. The measurements required are the velocities and positions of neutral hydrogen gas, combined with the approximation that the gas is rotating in nearly circular orbits around the centre of the Galaxy. A rotation curve, which relates the circular velocity of the gas to its distance from the galactic centre, is constructed. The shape of this curve and its values are determined by the amount of gravitational pull that the Galaxy exerts on the gas. Velocities are low in the central parts of the system because not much mass is interior to the orbit of the gas; most of the Galaxy is exterior to it and does not exert an inward gravitational pull. Velocities are high at intermediate distances because most of the mass in that case is inside the orbit of the gas clouds and the gravitational pull inward is at a maximum. At the farthest distances, the velocities decrease because nearly all the mass is interior to the clouds. This portion of the Galaxy is said to have Keplerian orbits, since the material should move in the same manner that the German astronomer Johannes Kepler discovered the planets to move within the solar system, where virtually all the mass is concentrated inside the orbits of the orbiting bodies. The total mass of the Galaxy is then found by constructing mathematical models of the system with different amounts of material distributed in various ways and by comparing the resulting velocity curves with the observed one. As applied in the 1960s, this procedure indicated that the total mass of the Galaxy was approximately 200 billion times the mass of the Sun.</p>
                <p>During the 1980s, however, refinements in the determination of the velocity curve began to cast doubts on the earlier results. The downward trend to lower velocities in the outer parts of the Galaxy was found to have been in error. Instead, the curve remained almost constant, indicating that there continue to be substantial amounts of matter exterior to the measured hydrogen gas. This in turn indicates that there must be some undetected material out there that is completely unexpected. It must extend considerably beyond the previously accepted positions of the edge of the Galaxy, and it must be dark at virtually all wavelengths, as it remains undetected even when searched for with radio, X-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, and optical telescopes. Until the dark matter is identified and its distribution determined, it will be impossible to measure the total mass of the Galaxy, so all that can be said is that the mass is at least several hundred billion, and possibly one trillion, times the mass of the Sun.</p>
                <p>The nature of the dark matter in the Galaxy remains one of the major questions of galactic astronomy. Many other galaxies also appear to have such undetected matter. In the 1990s astronomers carried out exhaustive lensing experiments involving the study of millions of stars in the galactic central areas and in the Magellanic Clouds to search for dark objects whose masses would cause lensed brightenings of background stars. Some lensing events were detected, but the number of dark objects inferred is not enough to explain completely the dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters. It is likely that the dark matter consists of some undiscovered particle, such as a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle).</p>

                <h2>Formation of the Milky Way </h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span></p>
                <p>n the early days of the universe, there were just floating plumes of hydrogen and helium gas everywhere. Some clumps begin to merge, creating more "dense" regions than others. The first stars were created from fusion reactions, and more and more stars were created as the gas continued to condense. The stars interact gravely with each other, creating the halo of the planet - the oldest structures in the universe. Billions of years after the birth of the first stars, their masses are already large enough to rotate themselves quite quickly.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously with the creation of new stars, older stars begin the process of "aging", ripping off the atmosphere or leading to supernova explosions, releasing abundant matter back into the initial cluster of gases, which contribute to younger stars with heavier elements. [31] This process is prolonged and repeated to this day, contributing to the creation of Earth and other planets (due to the composition of the gas clusters today is not merely hydrogen and helium as originally, but also contains many other heavy elements).</p>
                <p>Their masses continue to increase as new stars are constantly being created, plus they rotate quite rapidly around the axis, so the spherical shape initially begins to bulge, then gradually collapse, then eventually disc form. like today (preserving momentum). New stars later all formed on the surface of the "disc", forming the Milky Way we observe today.</p>
                <p>Nearly half of the matter in the Milky Way comes from other galaxies. At present, the Milky Way is deposited with material from the two nearest satellite galaxies: the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The characteristics of the Milky Way galaxy such as stellar mass, momentum, metal composition, etc. indicate that it has never merged with any significantly large galaxies in the past 10 billion years. Compared to other spiral galaxies, this is quite unusual; for example, the Fairy Galaxy was formed from the merger of a number of relatively large galaxies</p>
                <p>According to recent studies, the rate of star production in our Milky Way as well as the neighboring Tien Nu Galaxy is very slow, mainly due to the exhaustion of the necessary gas environment. This speed is divided into three regions of red, green, and blue with increasing star-creation rate. It is estimated that this process could be completely extinguished in about 5 billion years, even if the Fairy Galaxy and the Milky Way collided.</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 45px;">tructure of the spiral system</p>
                <p>The Milky Way Galaxy’s structure is fairly typical of a large spiral system. (Spiral galaxies and other types of galaxies are described in the article galaxy.) This structure can be viewed as consisting of six separate parts: (1) a nucleus, (2) a central bulge, (3) a disk (both a thin and a thick disk), (4) spiral arms, (5) a spherical component, and (6) a massive halo. Some of these components blend into each other.</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 60px;">he nucleus</p>
                <p>At the very centre of the Galaxy lies a remarkable object—a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk of high-temperature gas. Neither the central object nor any of the material immediately around it can be observed at optical wavelengths because of the thick screen of intervening dust in the Milky Way. The object, however, is readily detectable at radio wavelengths and has been dubbed Sagittarius A* by radio astronomers. Somewhat similar to the centres of active galaxies (see below), though on a lesser scale, the galactic nucleus is the site of a wide range of activity apparently powered by the black hole. Infrared radiation and X-rays are emitted from the area, and rapidly moving gas clouds can be observed there.</p>
                <p>Data strongly indicate that material is being pulled into the black hole from outside the nuclear region, including some gas from the z direction (i.e., perpendicular to the galactic plane). As the gas nears the black hole, the central object’s strong gravitational force squeezes the gas into a rapidly rotating disk, which extends outward about 5–30 light-years from the black hole. Rotation measurements of the disk and the orbital motions of stars (seen at infrared wavelengths) indicate that the black hole has a mass more than 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. (For the infrared observations that established that Sagittarius A* was a black hole, American astronomer Andrea Ghez and German astronomer Reinhard Genzel were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics.)</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 60px;">he central bulge</p>
                <p>Surrounding the nucleus is an extended bulge of stars that is nearly spherical in shape and that consists primarily of Population II stars, though they are comparatively rich in heavy elements. (For an explanation of Population II stars, see Stars and stellar populations.) Mixed with the stars are several globular clusters of similar stars, and both the stars and the clusters have nearly radial orbits around the nucleus. The bulge stars can be seen optically where they stick up above the obscuring dust of the galactic plane.</p>

                <p>From a distance the most conspicuous part of the Galaxy would be the disk, which extends from the nucleus out to approximately 75,000 light-years. The Galaxy resembles other spiral systems, featuring as it does a bright, flat arrangement of stars and gas clouds that is spread out over its entirety and marked by a spiral structure. The disk can be thought of as being the underlying body of stars upon which the arms are superimposed. This body has a thickness that is roughly one-fifth its diameter, but different components have different characteristic thicknesses. The thinnest component, often called the "thin disk," includes the dust and gas and the youngest stars, while a thicker component, the "thick disk,” includes somewhat older stars.</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 60px;">he spiral arms</p>
                <p>Astronomers did not know that the Galaxy had a spiral structure until 1953, when the distances to stellar associations were first obtained reliably. Because of the obscuring interstellar dust and the interior location of the solar system, the spiral structure is very difficult to detect optically. This structure is easier to discern from radio maps of either neutral hydrogen or molecular clouds, since both can be detected through the dust. Distances to the observed neutral hydrogen atoms must be estimated on the basis of measured velocities used in conjunction with a rotation curve for the Galaxy, which can be built up from measurements made at different galactic longitudes.</p>

The vertical axis represents velocity and the horizontal axis longitude. The gentle curves in the left and right portions of the map trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy. The vertical structure in the middle of the map is the centre of the Galaxy. The emission stretching from the upper left to the lower right in the middle portion of the map is the “molecular ring,” a ring of gas and dust in orbit between 4 and 8 kiloparsecs from the centre of the Galaxy.

                <p>From studies of other galaxies it can be shown that spiral arms generally follow a logarithmic spiral form such thatlog r = a − bϕ,where ϕ is a position angle measured from the centre to the outermost part of the arm, r is the distance from the centre of the galaxy, and a and b are constants. The range in pitch angles for galaxies is from about 50° to approximately 85°. The pitch angle is constant for any given galaxy if it follows a true logarithmic spiral. The pitch angle for the spiral arms of the Galaxy is difficult to determine from the limited optical data, but most measurements indicate a value of about 75°. There are three spiral arms in the part of the Milky Way Galaxy wherein the solar system is located.</p>
                <p>Theoretical understanding of the Galaxy’s spiral arms has progressed greatly since the 1950s, but there is still no complete understanding of the relative importance of the various effects thought to determine their structure. The overall pattern is almost certainly the result of a general dynamical effect known as a density-wave pattern. The American astronomers Chia-Chiao Lin and Frank H. Shu showed that a spiral shape is a natural result of any large-scale disturbance of the density distribution of stars in a galactic disk. When the interaction of the stars with one another is calculated, it is found that the resulting density distribution takes on a spiral pattern that does not rotate with the stars but rather moves around the nucleus more slowly as a fixed pattern. Individual stars in their orbits pass in and out of the spiral arms, slowing down in the arms temporarily and thereby causing the density enhancement. For the Galaxy, comparison of neutral hydrogen data with the calculations of Lin and Shu have shown that the pattern speed is 4 km/sec per 1,000 light-years.</p>
                <p>Other effects that can influence a galaxy’s spiral shape have been explored. It has been demonstrated, for example, that a general spiral pattern will result simply from the fact that the galaxy has differential rotation; i.e., the rotation speed is different at different distances from the galactic centre. Any disturbance, such as a sequence of stellar formation events that are sometimes found drawn out in a near-linear pattern, will eventually take on a spiral shape simply because of the differential rotation. For example, the outer spiral structure in some galaxies may be the result of tidal encounters with other galaxies or galactic cannibalism. Distortions that also can be included are the results of massive explosions such as supernova events. These, however, tend to have only fairly local effects.</p>

                <p>The space above and below the disk of the Galaxy is occupied by a thinly populated extension of the central bulge. Nearly spherical in shape, this region is populated by the outer globular clusters, but it also contains many individual field stars of extreme Population II, such as RR Lyrae variables and dwarf stars deficient in the heavy elements. Structurally, the spherical component resembles an elliptical galaxy, following the same simple mathematical law of how density varies with distance from the centre.</p>

                <p><p>The least-understood component of the Galaxy is the giant massive halo that is exterior to the entire visible part. The existence of the massive halo is demonstrated by its effect on the outer rotation curve of the Galaxy (see below Mass). All that can be said with any certainty is that the halo extends considerably beyond a distance of 100,000 light-years from the centre and that its mass is several times greater than the mass of the rest of the Galaxy taken together. It is not known what its shape is, what its constituents are, or how far into intergalactic space it extends.</p>

                <p class="size" style="margin-top: 60px;">agnetic field</p>
                <p>It was once thought that the spiral structure of galaxies might be controlled by a strong magnetic field. However, when the general magnetic field was detected by radio techniques, it was found to be too weak to have large-scale effects on galactic structure. The strength of the galactic field is only about 0.000001 times the strength of Earth’s field at its surface, a value that is much too low to have dynamical effects on the interstellar gas that could account for the order represented by the spiral-arm structure. This is, however, sufficient strength to cause a general alignment of the dust grains in interstellar space, a feature that is detected by measurements of the polarization of starlight. In the prevailing model of interstellar dust grains, the particles are shown to be rapidly spinning and to contain small amounts of metal (probably iron), though the primary constituents are ice and carbon. The magnetic field of the Galaxy can gradually act on the dust particles and cause their rotational axes to line up in such a way that their short axes are parallel to the direction of the field. The field itself is aligned along the Milky Way band, so that the short axes of the particles also become aligned along the galactic plane. Polarization measurements of stars at low galactic latitudes confirm this pattern.</p>

                <p>The motions of stars in the local stellar neighbourhood can be understood in terms of a general population of stars that have circular orbits of rotation around the distant galactic nucleus, with an admixture of stars that have more highly elliptical orbits and that appear to be high-velocity stars to a terrestrial observer as Earth moves with the Sun in its circular orbit. The general rotation of the disk stars was first detected through studies made in the 1920s, notably those of the Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad, who correctly interpreted the apparent asymmetries in stellar motions as the result of this multiple nature of stellar orbital characteristics.</p>
                <p>The disk component of the Galaxy rotates around the nucleus in a manner similar to the pattern for the planets of the solar system, which have nearly circular orbits around the Sun. Because the rotation rate is different at different distances from the centre of the Galaxy, the measured velocities of disk stars in different directions along the Milky Way exhibit different patterns. The Dutch astronomer Jan H. Oort first interpreted this effect in terms of galactic rotation motions, employing the radial velocities and proper motions of stars. He demonstrated that differential rotation leads to a systematic variation of the radial velocities of stars with galactic longitude following the mathematical expressionradial velocity = Ar sin 2l,where A is called Oort’s constant and is approximately 15 km/sec/kiloparsec (1 kiloparsec is 3,260 light-years), r is the distance to the star, and l is the galactic longitude.</p>
                <p>A similar expression can be derived for measured proper motions of stars. The agreement of observed data with Oort’s formulas was a landmark demonstration of the correctness of Lindblad’s ideas about stellar motions. It led to the modern understanding of the Galaxy as consisting of a giant rotating disk with other, more spherical, and more slowly rotating components superimposed.</p>
