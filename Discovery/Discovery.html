                            <p>Within the first single second of its existence the universe already went through various epochs. Starting with the Planck
                                epoch the whole universe was compressed in an area smaller than your fingertip. At this point temperatures were so high
                                that all four fundamental forces (gravitation, electromagnetism, weak nuclear interaction and strong nuclear interaction)
                                were unified into one single fundamental force. The Planck epoch ended 10-43 seconds after the Big Bang. We won't go into
                                too much detail, but after another few epochs (Grand unification epoch, Electroweak epoch, Quark epoch) the universe was
                                10-6 seconds young (one millionth of a second) and the fundamental forces had separated and taken their present form as
                                we know them today.</p>
                            <p>Let's not forget one other important epoch that occurred during this very first period: the inflationary epoch. This was
                                an epoch of heavy expansion of the young universe in which the volume of the universe is estimated to have increased by
                                a factor of 1078. It ended 10-32 seconds after the Big Bang and the universe was now about the size of a typical galaxy.
                                This doesn't mean that inflation of the universe itself stopped, just that the rate of expansion dramatically slowed
                                down. In fact the universe has been expanding until today.</p>
                            <p>At 10-6 seconds after the Big Bang the heavy expansion had lowered temperatures sufficiently for quarks to form and be
                                stable. Until 10-5 seconds the universe was composed of a "quark soup", an accumulation of the very basic building
                                blocks of matter (quarks, leptons, antileptons, gluons and extreme high energy radiation). But after 10-5 seconds the
                                universe had further expanded and cooled down enough to form stable protons and neutrons out of the quark soup.</p>
                            <p>At about 1 second after the Big Bang temperatures went down to about 1000 times the temperature of our Sun's core. You
                                could now expect that the protons would fuse to heavier elements since we have all the ingredients for a nuclear fusion:
                                protons and neutrons at high temperatures and high densities (like our Sun that in its core fuses hydrogen to helium at
                                temperatures of more than 15 million K). But we still have to wait a few minutes for this to happen due to the enormous
                                amount of high energy radiation in the early universe. As soon as the first step of the nuclear fusion chain to heavier
                                elements occurs (fusion of a proton and a neutron to form deuterium) the high energy radiation will immediately blast
                                apart the deuterium leaving us with just protons and neutrons again.</p>
                            <p>A few minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures and density dropped enough to pave the way for the era of nucleosynthesis.
                                Parts of the hydrogen nuclei (protons) now can fuse to helium without being immediately destroyed. Finally - about 15 to
                                20 minutes after the Big Bang - when temperatures have cooled down enough to inhibit any further fusion we are left with
                                a universe composed of roughly three quarters hydrogen and one quarter helium (this is by mass, counting the number of
                                atoms it consists of about 92% hydrogen atoms and 8% helium atoms). There were also some trace amounts of other elements
                                (mainly lithium and some radioactive isotopes), but until the first stars formed millions of years later the universe
                                was composed of 99.999999% hydrogen and helium.</p>

                            <p>By the way: are you wondering why the universe cools down during its expansion? The reason is quite simple: with the expansion of the universe the wavelengths of the radiation also get stretched and lose energy. Radiation with longer wavelengths (e.g. visible light) is less energetic than radiation with short wavelengths (like X-rays). Every time the universe doubles in size, its temperature is cut by a factor of two. Furthermore the density also changes: a doubled size leads to one eighth of matter density. So, the total energy density of the universe drops by a factor of 16 every time it doubles its size.</p>

                            <p> While the first 15 minutes of the universe were really eventful, nothing really important happened - apart from further
                                cooling and expanding - during the next hundreds of thousand years. Until 380 000 years after the Big Bang the
                                universe is still just a "particle soup" composed of atomic nuclei and free floating electrons. This universe is
                                still completely opaque since any radiation gets scattered in all directions by these free protons and electrons.</p>
                            <p> Around this time the universe got cool enough (about 3000 Kelvin) for the electrons and the atomic nuclei to combine
                                to form neutral atoms. This process is called recombination. From that point in time the universe became transparent
                                for a broad range of wavelengths. Since this radiation can now freely travel through space and is not scattered anymore,
                                we are able to see the liberated radiation of this time (380 000 years after the Big Bang) even today! Due to the
                                expansion of the universe from that point in time up to today, the radiation is stretched to a much longer wavelength
                                - namely microwaves. Today we can observe microwave radiation in every direction of the sky, no matter where we look.
                                This radiation is called the "Cosmic Microwave Background" (CMB) - it is the leftover of the Big Bang itself!</p>
                            </p>
                            <div class="discover-image">
                                <img src="../MEDIA/Gas_and_Plasma.gif" alt="Gas-and-Plasma" width="680" title="Gas and Plasma" />

                            </div>
                            <p>There is also a downside: this CMB forms a "wall" for any observation that we can conduct today. You can compare this
                                to our Sun: we will never be able to image the core of the Sun from outside due to the opaqueness of the inner parts
                                of the Sun. Why is the Sun opaque? Because the high temperatures inside the Sun cause a separation (or ionization) of
                                the electrons from the atomic nuclei, again leaving us with an opaque soup of protons and electrons. Any light is
                                scattered myriads of times in all different directions before it reaches the surface of the Sun after a voyage of
                                more than 100 000 years. The same is the case with the Cosmic Microwave Background: we can see the CMB itself, but
                                we will never be able to look behind this "wall". So, unfortunately we cannot see further back in time until 380 000
                                after Big Bang... and there is no hope that we might with better telescopes someday be able to see images of the Big
                                Bang itself. Anyhow, being able to see the leftovers of the Big Bang means being able to look back for 99.997% of the
                                time the universe has existed. And this is a marvellous achievement!</p>
                            <p>Because recombination did not occur instantaneously, in reality the CMB "wall" has a thickness of about 100 000 light
                                years. The Cosmic Microwave Background is an image of the state of the universe 380 000 years after Big Bang with just
                                very tiny fluctuations in temperature and density. These fluctuations were later amplified and led to the formation of
                                the first stars and galaxies. The peak of the radiation has a wavelength that corresponds to a mean temperature of less
                                than three degrees above absolute zero (2.725 K) with fluctuations of just a few hundred µK (less than 0.001 K).</p>
                            </p>

                            <p>2.725 K is the temperature that corresponds to the peak (strongest) radiation; in reality the radiation has many different wavelengths. The CMB behaves like a black body and any black body emits radiation in a broad range of wavelengths.</p>

                            <p>By the way: don't get confused by the 3000 Kelvin we mentioned above (the temperature of the universe after 380 000 years)
                                and the 2.725 Kelvin (the temperature of the CMB that we measure today). The difference comes from the expansion of the
                                universe itself that has stretched the wavelength of the radiation to the current low value. This process will continue
                                over the next billions of years since the universe continues to expand. The radiation from the CMB will have longer and
                                longer wavelengths or - expressed the other way round - the measured temperatures will get lower and lower.</p>

                            <p>The dark ages are the era when the universe was already transparent to many wavelengths, but no star had yet been formed. So there was no starlight emitted that we could observe today. The exact duration of the dark ages is not yet fully known. We have used 380 million years since recently a galaxy called UDFj-39546284 was discovered whose distance is 13.37 billion light years from us, hence was already existing about 380 million years after the Big Bang. Let's wait until the James Webb Space Telescope is up in the sky. This telescope will be able to push the observable frontier of the furthest galaxies still further into the past.</p>

                            <p>Even though around the year 380 000 the universe had already become transparent to light with longer wavelengths like infrared radiation or radio waves, it was still not transparent to visible light. The universe was composed of neutral atoms that are opaque to visible light, similar to the dark cloud Barnard 68 which is mainly composed of neutral gas.</p>

                            <p>But the birth of the first stars in the universe changed this: they emitted a strong ultraviolet radiation that started kicking off the electrons of the neutral atoms. This process is called reionization and led to a universe that is finally transparent to visible light too. The process of reionization is beautifully illustrated in the following video:</p>

                            <p>The first few hundred million years on Earth were tough. Huge asteroids and comets crashed onto Earth; even a planet of the size of Mars may have crashed into the young Earth, thereby forming our moon (Giant Impact Hypothesis). Earth's surface was completely molten; no life form as we know it could develop under these circumstances. But after about 500 - 600 million years things calmed down and the Earth could offer moderate temperatures and water. Surprise: not much later the first life on Earth evolved. Quite a fast victory of nature! If you think of the 10 billion planets just in the habitable zone of just our Milky Way... who cannot wonder how much life there might be out in the universe. Who knows, maybe one of the next generations of telescopes might already be able to trace molecules in other planets’ atmospheres that could only have been produced by a biological process (such as e.g. O2 in high concentrations)!</p>
