                <p>black hole also known as a black hole or black hole, is a region of space-time that has such a strong gravitational field that no matter in general occupies certain mass and space or what radiation and light can. escape. General relativity predicts that a sufficiently large amount of matter in a small enough range will deform spacetime to become a black hole. Around a black hole is a surface defined by a mathematical equation called the event horizon, where matter passes through it unable to escape the black hole. A black hole is called "black" because it absorbs all radiation and matter that is attracted through the event horizon, like an absolute black body in thermodynamics; It is also not some kind of "hole" or "hole" but a region of spacetime that does not allow anything to escape.</p>
                <p> Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that a black hole's event horizon will emit radiation like a black body with a certain temperature emits thermal radiation. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of average or stellar mass.</p>
                <p>In the 18th century, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace considered an object with a strong gravitational field described by classical mechanics that made light impossible to escape. The first modern theory of the character of a black hole was given by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 when he found the first exact solution to the Einstein field equation, [9] despite the physical significance and explanation of the spacetime region. the space in which nothing can escape was first invented by David Finkelstein in 1958. </p>
                <p>For a long time physicists considered Schwarzschild's solution to be a pure mathematical description. Until the 1960s, new theoretical studies showed that black holes formed according to the strict predictions of general relativity. When astronomers discover neutron stars, pulsars and Cygnus X-1 - a black hole in a binary star system, predictions of a gravitational collapse become a reality, and the concept of black holes together with special bodies transformed into theories that describe these special entities in the universe.</p>
                <p>In theory, stellar mass black holes form from the gravitational collapse of very large stars in the late stages of evolution. Once formed, they continue to attract matter from their surroundings, and their mass increases over time. Along with the process of merging and merging two or more black holes, there exist giant black holes with masses from several million to tens of billions of solar masses. Survey projects show that most at the center of a large galaxy exists at least one giant black hole.</p>
                <p>Although by definition it is a completely or invisible black body, the existence of a black hole can be speculated through its interaction with its surroundings and radiation such as light. Matter falling into the black hole forms an accretion zone, where the matter collides with each other, becoming a plasma state that emits intense radiation; making the environment surrounding a black hole one of the brightest objects in the universe.</p>
                <p>If there is a star orbiting the black hole, its shape and orbital period allows astronomers to calculate the black hole's mass and distance to it. These data help them distinguish whether a solid object is a black hole or a neutron star ... In this way, many of the detected black holes are in the binary star system, and at the center of the Milky Way there is a giant black hole. with a mass of approximately 4.3 million solar masses.</p>
                <p>The theory of black holes, where strong gravitational fields are concentrated in small regions of spacetime, is one of the theories that requires the synthesis of general relativity describing gravity with the Standard Model of mechanics. quantum. And today, theorists are still on the way of building quantum gravity to describe the singularity at the center of a black hole.</p>
                <p>The first directly measured event of gravitational waves announced by the LIGO group on February 11, 2016 also directly demonstrated the existence of a system of two stellar mass black holes orbiting each other and eventually merging to form. a black hole rotates more mass</p>

                <h2>Properties and structure</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span></p>
                <p>he Hairless Theorem states that, once a stable condition is reached after formation, a stationary black hole only needs three independent physical parameters to describe it: mass, charge, and dynamic moment. Any two black holes that share these physical properties, or each pair of three equal parameters, cannot be distinguished from each other according to classical (or non-quantum) mechanics.</p>
                <p>These properties are special because a person standing outside the black hole will measure these three parameters. For example, a charged black hole will repel other black holes with the same charge as in classical electrostatics. Similarly, the sum of mass (in the sense of energy + mass), the mass of ADM, inside a black hole can be found by using Gauss's law of gravity or observing the orbits of objects orbiting it. And for the moment of momentum, a distant person can be determined through the drag effect of the frame of reference caused by its rotation (the magnetic field of gravity).</p>
                <p>When an object falls into a black hole, any information about the object's shape, charge distribution ... completely disappears for observers standing far away from the black hole. The property of the event horizon in this situation is like a dissipation system similar to a two-dimensional membrane, on which to visualize the existence of a frictional liquid that is charged and conducting, in four dimensional spacetime — or membrane model of black holes.</p>
                <p>This property differs from other field theories of physics such as classical electromagnetic fields, in that they have no microscopic friction or conductivity, because they obey temporal symmetry, whereas a body Falling into a black hole cannot fly back out. Because the steady state after black hole formation only needs to be described by three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and electromagnetic fields of the black hole give very little.</p>
                <p>information about the state before its formation and about what falls into it. For example, if a cube-shaped artificial satellite falls into a black hole, we only know that, in principle, the black hole increases by the mass of the satellite, it is not possible to know whether the satellite has a cube or shape. round cylinder. In addition, there are many types of physical information lost, quantities that cannot be measured by a person standing far beyond the event horizon, including those that obey the law of conservation, quantum numbers, baryon number and lepton number, number of charged particles ... These are stated in more detail in the paradox of information lost in black holes.</p>

                <h2>Physical properties </h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span></p>
                <p>he simplest type of black hole is mass, with no charge or its axis. These black holes are described by the Schwarzschild metric named Karl Schwarzschild, who found the correct solution to the equation of general relativity in 1916. According to Birkhoff's theorem, this is the solution that describes the spacetime of the leg region.
                <p>This means that there is no difference between the gravitational field of a black hole and objects with a radius greater than a sphere of the same mass. common in the public knowledge of a black hole is that it draws everything around it toward its event horizon; Far outside the black hole, the gravitational field caused by a black hole curving spacetime around it becomes weaker and resembles the gravitational field of a sphere of the same mass.
                <p>There are also more general solutions that closely describe the reality of black holes. Charged spherical black holes are described by the Reissner – Nordström methane, yet in the universe most black holes are electrically neutral. The black hole is stationary and rotates around the description axis according to the Kerr's metric. The most general model for a stationary black hole that rotates around its axis and carries charge is the Kerr – Newman metric, discovered by Erza Newman.
                <p>In general relativity, the black hole mass can take any positive value, but the value of the charge and the moment of momentum is limited by its mass value. In the Planck unit, the total charge Q and the total angular momentum J satisfy the inequality
                <p>Classification by nature No rotation (J = 0) Rotation (J ≠ 0) Neutral (Q = 0) Schwarzschild Kerr Charge <br>(Q ≠ 0) Reissner – Nordström Kerr – Newman where M is the mass of the black hole. Black holes whose values of parameters satisfy the equal sign of the inequality are called extreme black holes. There also exist solutions to the Einstein field equation that violate this inequality, but there is no event horizon in the solution.
                <p>Theoretical physicists call these solutions the naked singularity, that is, the singularity where it is visible to the outside person or not prevented by an event horizon. Physicist Roger Penrose made cosmological censorship conjecture when he said that, apart from the Big Bang singularity, there is no naked singularity that occurs after the gravitational collapse of matter in the universe. The simulations on supercomputers support this hypothesis.
                <p>Due to the relatively large magnitude of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of stars are electrically neutral. There are also black holes that, after forming, rotate very rapidly around the axis, a property that can be derived from the law of conservation of momentum. It is possible that in a two-celestial system, GRS 1915 + 105 with a strong source of X-rays containing the black hole,  that astronomers measured its rotational velocity approximately approximately the maximum value calculated above. theory for a black hole.
                <p>In astrophysics, black holes are also classified by their mass regardless of the other two parameters; in addition to the property classification as mass, momentum J, or charge Q. The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass. its amount M
                <p>where rS is the Schwarzschild radius and MSun symbol.svg is the mass of the Sun. This relation is only correct for a black hole that is not orbiting and has no charge; for general black holes this can be more than 2 times as large.
                <p>By 2013, the smallest mass black hole ever measured was GRO J0422 + 32 with approximately 5 MSun symbol.svg, [67] although in 2008 NASA scientists announced the discovery of XTE J1650-500. Its mass is approximately 3.8 solar masses [68] but later measurements showed that it has at least 5-10 solar masses. [69] Some of the most massive black holes include: at the galactic center NGC 1277, 220 x 106 mm from Earth with a value of 17 x 109 MSun symbol.svg; [70] the OJ 287 black hole system with mass 100 x 106 and 17 ~ 18 x 109 MSun symbol.svg, respectively, located 3.5 x 109 mm from Earth; [71] at the galaxy center NGC 4889, 308 x 106 mm from Earth with a mass of 21 x 109 MSun symbol.svg (with uncertainty 6 ~ 37 x 109 MSun symbol.svg).

                <h2>Formation and evolution</h2>
                <p><span class="firstcharacter">B</span></p>
                <p>lack holes can form when a giant star bursts out of nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity. If the star is large enough, there is no force that can resist the growing gravity, and it will collapse to an infinite point of density. Before reaching this stage, within a certain radius (the event horizon) light itself becomes trapped and the object becomes invisible.
                <p>With the strange properties of the black hole as mentioned, a question naturally arises whether these bizarre objects exist in nature or are they just mathematical solutions in Einstein's equation. In 1939, in an Einstein paper, he thought that black holes did not form in the universe, arguing that the rotational momentum of particles during their collapse stabilized them at certain radii.  But just a few months later, Oppenheimer and his colleagues showed for the first time how the possibility of a black hole formed by general relativity.
                <p> When Schwarzschild found his solution, physicists at first thought that black holes could exist according to the laws of physics. Then, for many years Einstein and the physics community thought it did not exist again, only a few people were seriously interested in the question of the existence of this entity [118] and until the late 1950s They have shown that nothing can prevent massive stars from collapsing into black holes surrounded by event horizons.
                <p>When the event horizon formed during the collapse, Penrose proved that the gravitational singularity had to form within it, too. The Big Bang also appears gravitational singularities that do not require any form of strange matter (see Penrose-Hawking singularity theorem). Methic Kerr, the "hairless" theorem, the laws of black hole thermodynamics show that the physical properties of black holes are simple and can be grasped, now solid objects from physical objects theory becomes the study of astrophysics.
                <p>The basic process of black hole formation is the gravitational collapse of mass objects like old stars ..., but there are other processes that lead to black holes. Through observations at radio wavelengths, infrared and X-rays ... on the ground or from satellite observatories has shown that black holes do indeed exist in the universe.

            <p>ravitational collapse requires large matter density. In the current era of the universe these high densities existed only in stars, but at the time when the universe first formed after the Big Bang the matter density was very high at the time, with the ability to allow holes to form. primitive black. High density alone is not enough to allow a black hole to form because the uniform mass distribution does not cause matter to accumulate together.</p>
            <p> For primitive black holes to form in this dense environment, there must initially be a fluctuation in density that allows matter to accumulate together through gravity. Different models of the early universe give different predictions about this degree of fluctuation. Some models predict that primitive black holes will form, ranging from Planck mass levels to hundreds of solar masses. Primitive black holes could be involved in the formation of medium mass black holes. space and super mass black holes.</p>
